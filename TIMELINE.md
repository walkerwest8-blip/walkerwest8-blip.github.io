# Learning & Project Timeline

This timeline documents my progression in GIS from foundational skills
to applied spatial analysis, with an emphasis on reasoning and methodology.

## 2025

### Project 001 — Cobb County Park Access & Equity

**Focus:**
- GIS data modeling and cleanup
- Spatial joins and aggregation
- Normalization by land area, population, and income
- Equity-oriented interpretation

**Key Takeaways:**
- Learned to distinguish technician tasks from analyst decisions
- Developed comfort with ACS Census data and tract-level joins
- Practiced translating spatial outputs into planning-relevant insight
- Built a repeatable workflow for equity screening analyses

---

Future projects will build on this foundation with:
- additional demographic lenses
- network-based accessibility
- comparative multi-county analysis

- Clear cartographic communication
- Short-form written interpretation (maps + text)

# Walker West — GIS Portfolio (QGIS)

I build learning-focused GIS projects with **clear scope**, **reproducible structure**, and **honest limitations**.  
Focus areas: terrain, walkability, and landscape structure (QGIS).

---

## Now
**Active work (rolling):**
- **Cobb County Green Structure Typology** — Phase 1 patch-based classification and validation
- **Apartment Site Study** — terrain foundation and walkability context buildout
- **Terrain + Habitat Mapping** — terrain/drainage/movement context (private land; outputs only)
- **[Full project ledger →]** - (PROJECTS.md)
- **[Portfolio timeline →]** - (TIMELINE.md)

## Projects

### Cobb County Green Structure Typology (Georgia, USA)
County-wide analysis classifying green space by **spatial structure and fragmentation** (not NDVI).  
**Tools:** QGIS • **CRS:** EPSG:2240 • **Units:** Acres  
- Outputs: green mask, patch typology, summary tables, report (PDF)

### Apartment Site Study (in progress)
Terrain-informed walkability context analysis for a multi-building apartment complex.  
**Tools:** QGIS • **Approach:** slope/terrain + observed access constraints

---

### Terrain + Habitat Mapping (private land study)
Terrain, drainage, and movement context analysis for a privately managed parcel.  
**Note:** raw data and sensitive locations are intentionally omitted.

## Methods I’m Building Across Projects
- Raster preprocessing (clip, reproject, mask)
- Terrain derivatives (slope, hillshade)
- Raster → vector conversion and patch analysis
- Clear cartography and documented assumptions
- [Methods index →] (METHODS.md)

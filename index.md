## GIS Portfolio (QGIS)

This portfolio documents my development in GIS through hands-on spatial analysis using real places and practical questions. My work focuses on terrain, access, and how physical landscapes influence movement and use.

I’m early in this field, and I’m intentionally building strong fundamentals: clear workflows, understandable maps, and documentation that explains both results and decisions.

## Current Focus

I’m concentrating on skills that consistently matter in applied GIS work:

- QGIS fundamentals (raster and vector workflows)
- Terrain and site analysis using elevation data
- Clean data organization and project structure
- Cartographic clarity and readable map layouts
- Written documentation of methods and limitations

## Projects

### Apartment Site Study *(in progress)*

**Context**  
A multi-building apartment complex with uneven terrain, mixed pedestrian infrastructure, and informal desire paths.

**Purpose**  
To understand how terrain and site design influence walkable access to nearby daily-use destinations.

**Key questions**
- Which routes minimize physical effort (slope) while remaining reasonably direct?
- Where do environmental comfort factors support or undermine walkability?
- How does parking layout and internal circulation affect pedestrian movement?

**Work in progress**
- Digitized pedestrian networks (formal and informal)
- Terrain-derived layers (slope and related surfaces)
- Route comparisons (shortest vs least-effort)
- Map layouts that emphasize explanation over decoration

### Terrain & Habitat Mapping *(Private Land Study)*

**Context**  
Privately managed rural land where terrain, drainage, and access patterns directly affect movement and observation on the ground.

**Purpose**  
To use elevation data and field knowledge to interpret subtle terrain features and their practical implications.

**Focus areas**
- Micro-terrain interpretation (ridges, bowls, draws, benches)
- Drainage patterns and wetness indicators
- Slope-aware access planning
- Terrain-informed movement hypotheses

**Work in progress**
- Multi-azimuth hillshades and contours
- Slope and aspect analysis
- Drainage indicators (flow direction and accumulation)
- Vector layers tied to field notes

## Project Structure

Each project follows a consistent structure to support review and reproducibility:

- `README.md` — purpose, questions, data sources, workflow, outputs
- `data/` — raw and processed data clearly separated
- `qgis/` — project files and styles
- `maps/` — exported layouts (PNG/PDF)
- `notes/` — assumptions, decisions, and lessons learned

Large datasets are referenced but not stored directly in the repository.

## Tools

- QGIS
- Open elevation and public data sources
- GitHub for documentation and version control

---

## Status

This portfolio is actively under construction and updated as projects progress. The emphasis is on steady improvement, clear methods, and honest documentation.

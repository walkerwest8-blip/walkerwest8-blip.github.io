# GIS Analysis Portfolio

Hi — I’m Walker West.  
This site documents my progression from GIS fundamentals into **applied spatial analysis** and **equity-oriented decision support**.

Rather than focusing on isolated maps, each project emphasizes:
- how analytical questions are framed  
- how data limitations and assumptions are handled  
- how spatial results are interpreted for real-world planning contexts  

The goal is to demonstrate **analyst thinking**, not just technical execution.

## About

I’m Walker West, a Geography student building practical GIS experience with a focus on
**spatial analysis, normalization, and equity-oriented decision support**.

I approach GIS as an analytical system rather than a map-making exercise. My work centers
on framing the right questions, choosing defensible metrics, documenting assumptions,
and clearly stating limitations so results can support real planning and policy decisions.

I have an AuDHD cognitive profile, which strongly shapes how I work—in productive ways.
I tend to think in systems, patterns, and layers, and I’m naturally drawn to asking
“what’s actually being measured here?” rather than stopping at surface-level outputs.
This often leads me to stress-test metrics, explore alternative normalizations, and be
explicit about uncertainty and edge cases.

My interests sit at the intersection of **public space, land use, access, and equity**,
particularly where spatial data can reveal mismatches between infrastructure and the
communities it serves. I’m especially motivated by projects that translate complex
spatial data into clear, responsible insight for decision-makers.

This portfolio documents real workflows using open data and QGIS, emphasizing progression
from foundational techniques to applied analysis rather than isolated demonstrations.

## Featured Project

### Project 001 — Cobb County Park Access & Equity

An end-to-end GIS analysis examining how public park access varies across
census tracts in Cobb County, Georgia when progressively normalized by:
- land area  
- population  
- household income  

The project demonstrates spatial aggregation, normalization, and
equity framing using publicly available data, with clear documentation
of methods and limitations.

## Analytical Approach

I treat GIS as an **analytical decision-support tool**, not just a cartographic one.  
Each project prioritizes:
- defensible metrics over visual complexity  
- transparency around assumptions and constraints  
- interpretations that can inform planning and policy discussions

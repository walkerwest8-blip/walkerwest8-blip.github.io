# GIS Analysis Portfolio

Hi — I’m Walker West.  
This site documents my progression from GIS fundamentals into **applied spatial analysis** and **equity-oriented decision support**.

Rather than focusing on isolated maps, each project emphasizes:
- how analytical questions are framed  
- how data limitations and assumptions are handled  
- how spatial results are interpreted for real-world planning contexts  

The goal is to demonstrate **analyst thinking**, not just technical execution.

## Featured Project

### Project 001 — Cobb County Park Access & Equity

An end-to-end GIS analysis examining how public park access varies across
census tracts in Cobb County, Georgia when progressively normalized by:
- land area  
- population  
- household income  

The project demonstrates spatial aggregation, normalization, and
equity framing using publicly available data, with clear documentation
of methods and limitations.

## Analytical Approach

I treat GIS as an **analytical decision-support tool**, not just a cartographic one.  
Each project prioritizes:
- defensible metrics over visual complexity  
- transparency around assumptions and constraints  
- interpretations that can inform planning and policy discussions

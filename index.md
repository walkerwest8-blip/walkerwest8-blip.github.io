# GIS Analysis Portfolio

Hi — I’m Walker West.  
This site documents my progression from GIS fundamentals into
applied spatial analysis and equity-focused decision support.

Rather than isolated maps, each project demonstrates:
- how a question was framed
- how data limitations were handled
- how spatial results were interpreted responsibly

## Featured Project

### Project 001 — Cobb County Park Access & Equity

An end-to-end GIS analysis examining how public park access varies across
census tracts in Cobb County, Georgia when normalized by:
- land area
- population
- household income

The project demonstrates spatial aggregation, normalization, and
equity framing using publicly available data.

## Approach

I treat GIS as an **analytical tool**, not just a mapping tool.
Every project prioritizes:
- clarity of assumptions
- defensible metrics
- documented limitations

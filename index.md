## GIS Portfolio (QGIS)

I use GIS to understand how **terrain, infrastructure, and human decisions interact on the ground**.  
This portfolio documents my development as a GIS practitioner through real places, real constraints, and repeatable spatial methods.

I’m not chasing perfect maps.  
I’m building **clear questions, defensible workflows, and maps that explain something true**.

## How I Think About GIS

To me, GIS is not software.  
It’s a way of slowing down a landscape long enough to ask better questions.

I’m especially interested in:
- how **terrain quietly shapes movement**, effort, and access
- how **small spatial decisions compound** into good or bad outcomes
- how maps can move from “technically correct” to **legible and useful**

Most of my work starts with a simple question and gets refined through iteration, failure, and re-mapping.

## Current Focus

Right now, I’m concentrating on fundamentals that actually matter in practice:

- **Raster workflows**  
  DEMs, slope, aspect, hillshade, and terrain-derived surfaces  
- **Vector workflows**  
  Clean digitizing, attribute design, topology awareness  
- **Site & terrain analysis**  
  Access, effort, drainage, and spatial constraints  
- **Cartographic clarity**  
  Maps that communicate hierarchy, intent, and uncertainty  
- **Documentation**  
  Writing down *what I did, why I did it, and what I’d change next time*

## Projects

### Apartment Site Study *(in progress)*

**Context**  
A multi-building apartment complex with inconsistent pedestrian infrastructure, uneven terrain, and informal desire paths.

**Why this project exists**  
People walk here every day. Some routes feel exhausting. Others feel indirect.  
This project asks: *what is the landscape actually asking people to do?*

**Primary questions**
- Which walking routes minimize **physical effort** (slope) while staying reasonably direct?
- Where do environmental comfort factors (lighting, openness, noise proxies) support or undermine walkability?
- How does parking layout and internal circulation affect pedestrian access to exits and nearby destinations?

**Methods in play**
- DEM-derived slope and effort surfaces  
- Digitized pedestrian networks and informal paths  
- Route comparisons (shortest vs least-effort)  
- Map layouts focused on explanation, not decoration

**Status**  
Active build. Data assembly, digitizing, and first-pass analysis underway.

### Terrain & Habitat Mapping *(Private Land Study)*

**Context**  
Privately managed rural land where terrain, drainage, and access directly affect movement—human and animal.

**Why this project exists**  
Subtle terrain features often matter more than obvious ones.  
This project uses elevation data and field knowledge to make those features visible and testable.

**Focus areas**
- Micro-terrain interpretation (ridges, bowls, draws, benches)
- Drainage patterns and wetness indicators
- Quiet, slope-aware access planning
- Terrain-informed hypotheses about movement patterns

**Methods in play**
- Multi-azimuth hillshades and contours  
- Slope and aspect analysis  
- Flow direction and accumulation  
- Stand and access layers tied to observation

**Status**  
Active build. Terrain products and structure mapping in progress.

## How Projects Are Organized

Each project follows the same structure so the work is easy to review and reproduce:

- `README.md` — purpose, questions, data sources, methods, limitations, next steps  
- `data/` — raw vs processed clearly separated  
- `qgis/` — project files and styles  
- `maps/` — exported layouts (PNG/PDF)  
- `notes/` — assumptions, decisions, and lessons learned  

If something is messy, I document *why* it’s messy.

---

## Tools

- **QGIS**  
- **Open elevation and public data sources**  
- **GitHub** for versioned documentation and transparency  

---

## Portfolio Status

This portfolio is **actively under construction**.  
I prioritize:
- sound spatial reasoning over flashy outputs  
- clarity over cleverness  
- honesty about limitations

Each project represents a snapshot of where my thinking was at the time—and where it’s heading next.

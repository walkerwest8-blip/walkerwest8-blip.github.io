# Walker West — GIS Portfolio (QGIS)

I build learning-focused GIS projects with **clear scope**, **reproducible structure**, and **honest limitations**.  
Focus areas: terrain, walkability, and landscape structure (QGIS).

## Latest Project Updates

- **Cobb County Green Structure Typology** — Completed structural classification; corridors dominate county-wide green connectivity (Dec 2025)
- **Apartment Site Study** — Terrain and slope surfaces established; pedestrian comfort analysis in progress
- **Terrain + Habitat Mapping** — Drainage and movement context mapping underway

## Projects

### Cobb County Green Structure Typology (Georgia, USA)
**Status:** Complete  
County-wide classification of green space based on spatial structure (patch size, shape, and corridors), using public data and QGIS only.

- **Repository:** [cobb-green-structure-typology](https://github.com/walkerwest8-blip/cobb-green-structure-typology)
- **Project status & results:** [PROJECT_STATUS.md](https://github.com/walkerwest8-blip/cobb-green-structure-typology/blob/main/PROJECT_STATUS.md)

---

### Apartment Site Study
**Status:** Active  
Terrain-informed walkability and access analysis for a multi-building apartment complex.

- **Repository:** [apartment-site-study](https://github.com/walkerwest8-blip/apartment-site-study)

---

### Terrain + Habitat Mapping
**Status:** Active  
Terrain, drainage, and movement context analysis for a privately managed land parcel.

- **Repository:** [terrain-habitat-mapping](https://github.com/walkerwest8-blip/terrain-habitat-mapping)

## Portfolio Documentation

- [Methods index](METHODS.md) — GIS methods demonstrated across projects
- [Project timeline](TIMELINE.md) — development milestones and phases
- [Project ledger](PROJECTS.md) — portfolio-wide project status


## Methods I’m Building Across Projects
- Raster preprocessing (clip, reproject, mask)
- Terrain derivatives (slope, hillshade)
- Raster → vector conversion and patch analysis
- Clear cartography and documented assumptions
- [Methods index →] (METHODS.md)

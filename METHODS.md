## Raster Data Handling
- Raster clipping and masking to defined study extents
- CRS harmonization and unit control (feet- and acres-based workflows)
- Derivation of terrain surfaces (slope, hillshade)

**Demonstrated in:**
- Apartment Site Study
- Terrain + Habitat Mapping
- Cobb County Green Structure Typology

---

## Raster → Vector Workflows
- Binary classification (green / non-green masking)
- Polygonization of raster outputs
- Attribute cleanup and geometry validation

**Demonstrated in:**
- Cobb County Green Structure Typology

---

## Patch and Structural Analysis
- Patch area calculation using projected CRS
- Structural classification based on size thresholds
- Fragmentation-aware interpretation (edge vs core vs residual)

**Demonstrated in:**
- Cobb County Green Structure Typology

---

## Terrain and Movement Context
- Terrain-informed movement constraints
- Slope as a relative effort proxy (non-compliance framing)
- Interpretation of drainage and surface form for movement

**Demonstrated in:**
- Apartment Site Study
- Terrain + Habitat Mapping

---

## Cartography and Communication
- Clear map layouts focused on interpretability
- Export of portfolio-ready figures
- Documentation of assumptions and limitations alongside visuals

**Demonstrated in:**
- All projects

---

## Workflow Discipline
- Separation of raw, processed, and output data
- Reproducible folder structures
- Explicit scope, exclusions, and limitations

**Demonstrated in:**
- All projects

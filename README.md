# Walker West — GIS Portfolio

This repository hosts my GitHub Pages site.

👉 **Live site:** https://walkerwest8-blip.github.io

The portfolio documents my development in GIS using QGIS, with a focus on
real-world spatial analysis, clear workflows, and honest documentation.

Projects are organized in separate repositories and linked from the site.

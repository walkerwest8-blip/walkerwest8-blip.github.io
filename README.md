# GIS Portfolio — Walker West

This repository is a growing portfolio of applied GIS projects focused on spatial analysis,
data normalization, and equity-oriented decision support.

Projects here emphasize **analyst thinking over cartography**:
asking the right questions, choosing appropriate metrics, documenting limitations,
and translating spatial data into planning-relevant insight.

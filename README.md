# Walker West — GIS Portfolio

This repository hosts my **GitHub Pages portfolio site**, which serves as a central hub for my GIS work using **QGIS**.

👉 **Live site:** https://walkerwest8-blip.github.io

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio documents my development in GIS with a focus on:

- Real-world spatial analysis
- Clear scope and stated limitations
- Reproducible workflows and file organization
- Honest documentation over polished but opaque results

Projects are organized in **separate repositories** and linked from the site.  
This repository contains **navigation, summaries, and portfolio-wide documentation**, not project data.
